Why use it ?
------------

Why should you use Commerce Abandoned Cart as email marketing for Drupal Commerce ?

* The view displays the abandoned carts with the user e-mail address associated
* This module is 100% integrated with the Commerce Views Bulk Operations (VBO) module

--------------------
How does that work ?
--------------------

Go to the view page : /admin/commerce/orders/abandoned_carts

* Select the customers you want to notify (the module does not allow you to notify a user more than once... Don't be a spammer ^^)
* Select the component : "Notify the user of his abandoned cart" and click on "Execute"
Note : You can edit the mail that will be sent to the customer by modifying the Rule component.
